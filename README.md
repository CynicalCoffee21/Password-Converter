# Password-Converter
Converts phrases/words/sentences to more secure passwords.
/**
 * This program is essentially a way to turn sentences/phrases/words into password acceptable alternatives.
 * It replaces spaces with underscores, and certain letters with numbers/symbols.
 * 
 * For example, here are some words/phrases and their converted alternatives (according to the program):
 *     password  :  p@ssw0rd
 *     bad password phrase  :  b@d_p@ssw0rd_phr@s3
 *     Applicable test sentence for the program.  :  4ppl!c@bl3_t3st_s3nt3nc3_f0r_th3_pr0gr@m.
 * 
 * It is somewhat predictable after a while, or if you know how it works (which isn't that complicated really)
 * but it's still a decent way of turning regular text passwords into something a little more secure.
